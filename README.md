# Welcome to the Drone Classification System Project!

I am excited to introduce you to our research project, which is centred around developing a highly accurate and efficient drone classification system. In this endeavour, our primary objective is to propel the detection and classification system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to new heights by harnessing the power of acoustic data.

## Getting Started
If you're eager to get involved with our project, here's a starting point:
- Set up the necessary hardware and software infrastructure, including microphones or acoustic sensors.
- Install the required libraries and dependencies as specified in our project documentation.
- Consider contributing to our dataset by sharing relevant acoustic signatures for training and testing purposes.
